'''
For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.

Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.
