'''
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

    def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        return goal in s + s and len(goal) == len(s)
