'''
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of size n consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply n - 1 operations to this array where, in the ith operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the ith element of nums:

If nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then multiply nums[i] by 2 and set nums[i + 1] to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.

For example, the array [1,0,2,0,0,1] after shifting all its 0's to the end, is [1,2,1,0,0,0].
Return the resulting array.

Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.
